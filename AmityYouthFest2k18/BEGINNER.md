## Worried about attending your first hackathon?
You should be excited instead of being worried. If you aim to have a learning experience, hackathons are the best place to be. Hackathons are really fun and relaxed events, where you can learn how to create something.
Hackathons are 24+ hour tech-fests. They’re places where you meet like-minded people, learn new things, and work with cool technology and most important of them all have fun. They could sound pretty intimidating but you don’t have to be some sort of genius or a coding pro to take part in it.

## Do hackathon have something to do with "hack"?
Many people before you have the same misconception. The word “hack" confuses people and they think hackathons are about “hacking” into something.A big NO. Hacking is basically building something. It could be anything.   
 
 ```In computing, a hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem. - Wikipedia ```

## What do I do at a hackathon?
When you arrive at a hackathon, most important thing, start interacting. Talk about ideas, technologies, projects. Bring some ideas of your own and make up new ones throughout the day. Even bring up ridiculous ideas. Even if they're impossible to build or you wouldn't care to build them anyway, they can be fun to talk about and often spark new ideas in people. The mind of an engineer is a strange place.

Hackathons are very much a social event. So don’t waste any opportunity to talk to somebody. The organizers will come up and tell you a bit about the event and what’s planned.

Then hacking begins. You’ll team up with some other students to have fun making something cool. You can make anything you want using whatever technology you want. And it doesn’t have to be to win a prize. Hackathons aren’t really about winning prizes. They’re about playing with awesome technology and learning new things in life.

You’ll be able to spend a full 24 hours working on your project, if you so desire. But you can take a break to eat some of the  meals and snacks in provision and grab some sleep. Usually there is some fun activities so, that everyone can have a nice break from working.

It will be a crazy rush to get your project finished. There will be last-minute bugs everywhere. But eventually you’ll have to call it a day. Hacking’s over and it’s demo time.

Everybody will demo their hacks in front of everybody else and the judges. It doesn’t matter if your hack doesn’t work properly or if you what you made was dumb, it’s a chance to share what you learned over the weekend. Just leave all your ego behind and learn from people, ask them where you are stuck. And it’s so cool seeing what everyone else made. It's just you and your 5 minutes of fame.

## Why should I participate in a hackathon?
There are three big reasons,hackathons are worth attending.

1. __Hackathons are for learning__

Take hackathons as the de-facto learning experience. You would not just to learn how to code, but try to learn coding standards, collaborating with teams, exploring new crazy ideas and how others look at the things and try to understand their perspective, these lessons are invalulable. There is a reason why experience matters, it helps you understand where things can fail and how and why certain things are done the way they are.

You’ll gain more practical knowledge in one hackathon than you learn in a month of lectures. You grasp concepts faster, work with others, manage projects, use libraries, frameworks, and APIs that are used by software engineers every day, how to work to a deadline, how to debug, how to do version control, how to deploy, how to test and improve your work, how to present your work on stage, and much more. 

2. __Hackathons are for meeting people__

Hackathons are being time-sensitive, makes it an ample opportunity for great bonding experiences. If you’re into tech or making stuff, you’re going to love the inventive, smart, fun people you meet at hackathons. You get to experience pair-programming. It’s best to find someone of a similar skill level, and take turns “driving” (typing) and advising.  It’s a fantastic place to share ideas, learn from others, and build connections. When you attend a hackathon you learn, how different people approach a problem differently.

Speaking of building connections, hackathons are like career fairs on steroids. If you’re looking for an internship or a job in the tech industry, guess where companies are recruiting? At hackathons of course! Unlike career fairs, you have a proper chance to meet the developers. You can spend a weekend with them, learning from them, pick up new tips and tricks, showing them your work, and making an impression. These might just help you get your next job/internship.

3. __Hackathon = free of cost__

Best thing you don't have to pay for accommodation and as a participant, you can enjoy the freebies, free food, fun activities, socialize, and have a great experience. Also, likelihood is you’re going to walk away with some cool free t-shirts, stickers, or prizes.

**For beginners**, personally, this might be the best place to actually start on their path to being a developer. You shouldn’t be scared of hackathons if you are a beginner. There might be some anxiety and that's normal. Everyone is anxious, even we are. Till then start talking to the person next to you and start hacking.

## Refer this FAQ:

### What if I don’t know how to code?
No problem! Complete beginners come at every hackathon. If you’ve never coded before, it’s a great opportunity to spend and start learning. It's like you see people coding everywhere and some develop interest in coding after attending hackathon. You will get to learn how people make themselves comfortable with new skills. You’ll be surrounded by experienced coders, willing to help you out. Coding might seem complex, but actually it’s pretty easy to get started. 

### Will I annoy people if I ask them questions?
You’re not going to annoy anybody! These events are wholly centred around learning and having fun.
You’re meant to go and ask questions wherever you are stuck. Everybody will be willing to listen to your questions and help you learn new things. There will also be mentors working in top tech-companies who would be present to listen to questions and help you out.

If you can’t find somebody to help you out, go ask the volunteers. If they can’t help you themselves, they’ll help find you somebody who can.

### What if I don’t know anybody there?
Not to worry! Approach hackathons with the willingness to meet people and a open mind to learn, and you’ll have a fantastic experience. A lot of people go to hackathons without teams, don't hesitate ask people and team up with them. So it’s perfectly normal to go around people as all will be eager to know and connect with people, however there are developers who say they made a ton of contacts and friends at hackathons, many which last long after the hackathon wraps up.

Hackathons will often run team-matching sessions at the start to help you meet people. And you can often join social groups for the event beforehand and post there to find potential teammates.
Invite your friends to come to the hackathon too! That way you’re guaranteed to have at least one familiar face.

### What if I don’t have an idea?
That’s normal. Most people don’t have an idea before they get to the event. But once you start talking to other people, you might come up with something. You can also work with somebody else on their idea if you like it. It's not about always having an idea,but when you attend a hackathon you learn how different people approach a problem differently.And there will be prizes at the event which might help give you some ideas. Don’t worry about it, you’ll find something to work on.

### What if I don’t want to present my hack?
You might think your hack isn’t impressive enough to present or you might think it won’t win a prize so why bother? Don’t be silly. Hackathons aren’t about winning prizes. And they aren’t about showing off. They’re about learning and playing with technology and learn how to work as a team. There is absolutely no reason not to share what you’ve been working on for the past 24 hours. Even if your hack doesn’t work or you couldn’t finish it, people like hearing about what you tried to do, what challenges you faced, what technology you used, and what you learned. Atleast participate and be the part of amazing fun filled tech event.
